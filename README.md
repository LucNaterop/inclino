# Usage (Windows)

Download [inclino.exe](https://www.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/u19pco0bwyio1qn/inclino.exe) and save it for example on your desktop. 

Run `inclino.exe`. It might take 20-30 seconds before the script runs in the command line. 

It will ask for a file `example.csv` which is a csv file containing inclination measurement series as columns, just as can be seen in `example.csv`. Make sure that the csv files are in the same folder as `inclino.exe`. 

The script will ask for a bunch of parameters which are defined in the figure below. It will then go on to compute A(t) and save resulting graphs in the working directory.
